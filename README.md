# Spotify-data-Analysis
Spotify analysis.pnyb contains the code for analysis of your streaming history.
Dataset.pynb is to make data set with song attributes for a playlist.
Output folder contains Interactive graph that I obtained from my analysis. I recomend you to download the repo completely and load the html files in any of your browser.
